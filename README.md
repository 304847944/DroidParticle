### What is DroidParticle?
DroidParcile is a particle system library for Android applications.<br/>
A particle system is usually used to present visual effects like fire, cloud, fog, and many other cool things.<br/>
Although common animations may somehow satisfy these needs, but particle system is better for it is more randomized and vivid.

### How it works?
Like other particle system, DroidParticle presents the visual effect by emitting many "particle"s.<br/>
And a "particle" has following features:
* With a life duration
* Presented by a very simple image
* It moves!
* With many parameters like alpha, velocity, direction, color, etc.
* Its parameters changes during its life time
* All the particles in one system changes their own parameters in a specified way, which is designed by user.
The particle systems emit particles at a specified rate.<br/>

### Anything special?

* DroidParticle is only for Android
* It is based on common Android graphic API instead of OpenGL
* It is light weight and small
* It has a marvelous demo which can help you understand all it parameters
